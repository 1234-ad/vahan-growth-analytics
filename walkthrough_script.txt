Hi — I’m Aditya Rastogi. This is my submission for the Backend Developer Internship assignment: an investor-focused interactive dashboard that visualizes VAHAN vehicle registrations, with YoY and QoQ growth for categories and manufacturers.

(0:18) What I built:
- A Streamlit dashboard that reads registration data and allows date-range selection, vehicle-category and maker filters, and aggregation (monthly/quarterly/yearly).
- It computes YoY and QoQ automatically and shows trend charts and downloadable CSVs.

(0:40) How to run:
- Clone the repo, install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), put a CSV at `data/vahan_data.csv`, and run `streamlit run src/app.py`.
- If you don’t have a CSV, download maker/category CSV from India Data Portal or VAHAN public analytics (links in README).

(1:05) Key UI demo:
- Show sidebar controls: date range, aggregation, categories, makers.
- Toggle aggregation to Quarterly and show QoQ numbers updating.
- Select top makers and show trend lines and percent-change table.

(2:20) Data provenance & collection:
- I used the VAHAN public analytics as the source of truth and recommend using the India Data Portal mirror to avoid CAPTCHA issues. Links and instructions are in the README.

(2:45) Key investor insights:
- Example: EV/PE trends — electric vehicle registrations have X% YoY growth vs ICE in selected states (replace X with your computed number from your dataset).
- Manufacturer consolidation — top 3 makers represent Y% of registrations in last 12 months (replace Y from the dashboard).
- Seasonal patterns — registration dips in monsoon months result in QoQ declines; good for timing promotions/production planning.

(3:30) Next steps / roadmap:
- Add scheduled ETL, SQL storage, and forecasting models; add financial KPIs (revenue per registration) if fee data is available.

(3:50) That’s it. Repo link & README are included. Thank you!
